# Pypi Search

![pypi search](https://github.com/duartqx/images/blob/main/pypi-search.png?raw=true "pypi search")

Since the default 'pip search' does not work anymore and returns an error I've made a simple python script called pypi-search that gets search results from pypi website and prints to the terminal.
sourcing the bashfunction if I use the command 'pip search module' bash then calls my pypi-search script instead of pip(1) and uses the original pip for anything other than a search
